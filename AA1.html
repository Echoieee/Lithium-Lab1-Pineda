		The player starts as foul maidenless Tarnished,Well what is a Tarnished? Ages ago, the warrior Hoarah Loux became the consort of Queen Marika, taking the title of First Elden Lord and the name Godfrey. Queen Marika is a goddess figure, people will probably tell you different stuff about her because I haven't truly understood the plot yet but suffice for this write that she is The Goddess.
		Anyways back to Tarnished, the Tarnished were once followers of Lord Godfrey. At some point, for reasons not entirely clear, Marika withdrew the light of grace that guided Godfrey and his followers, sending them into exile, in an event known as the Long March. So the Tarnished followed Godfrey on the long march into foreign lands, where Tarnished all battled without grace and eventually died.
		But, as Marika promised before the exile, we eventually return to life and are drawn back to the Lands Between, our grace restored. That is where the story begins, we awake along with the other Tarnished and fumble back into the Lands Between, where it seems the light of grace bids us to seek out the Elden Ring in order to be Elden Lord.
		The world as we find it, In the interim period between us being dead and showing back up, lots of shit happened in the Lands Between. This is related to most of the stuff in the game. Marika smashed the Elden Ring at some point, and following that event there was eventually a massive war fought between the demigods that are her offspring one way or another, a war known as "The Shattering". Nobody really won this war, and we end in a state where a bunch of demigods each held on to a shard of the Elden Ring.
		So what we do in this game at its most basic level is, in order to mend the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord, we bonk enough demigods to get enough shards to be able to put the Elden Ring back together again.
		Of course there is a lot more going on than this summary, there's also the whole deal with Godwyn and the Nigh of the Black Knives and Those who live in Death, the whole deal with the curse and the Omens, Mogh's creepy little cult, and all, but I would say this is the most basic background </p>
